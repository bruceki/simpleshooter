Simple shooter app v1.0
Bruce Lee
****

Requirements:


appjs (latest) - https://github.com/appjs/appjs
NVM (for easily switching your node version) - https://github.com/creationix/nvm
node version 0.8 *** IMPORTANT *** 
app.js seems to work best with this older version of node. use NVM to install it and switch to it like so from your terminal:

nvm install 0.8

it should automatically use it if you have configured everything correctly. if not, use:

nvm use 0.8

and it should work. to switch back to the latest version ( node v0.10.xx as of writing this) do this:

nvm install 0.10


********************
running the app
********************
use terminal to navigate into the directory with the app.js file in the main directory and use:

(linux)
node --harmony app.js

(windows)
copy and paste your node exe into the main directory, execute

now blast some pottery!
